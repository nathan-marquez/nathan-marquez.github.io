# Ploopy - Therapeutic AI Journaling Companion

![Ploopy Demo](media/ploopy/ploopy_demo.mp4)

A cute journaling companion I built with [Katrina](https://www.lemonyummy.com/)! This was our project for [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/), a six week long hackathon. 

# What is Ploopy?
Ploopy is squishy companion that lives in a mobile app. Ploopy is generated from a dynamic personality test, which leverages AI to create personality questions on the fly. We extract various dimensions of your test to create a "personality vector", which provides some seed input to procedurally generate your ploopy. Here is Katrina's ploopy:

Ploopy offers daily advice to you, and you feed your ploopy by entering daily journal entries. The more you journal, the healthy your ploopy is, and the more insightful ploopy's advice becomes.

# Buildspace Demo Day

Here are some fun moments from the Buildspace demo day. This was an in person event in the San Francisco Marina district that saw hundreds of people across the world come together to demo and work on their projects. We met a ton of great friends here.
