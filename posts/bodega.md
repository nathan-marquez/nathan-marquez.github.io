# BODEGA - TikTok for Fashion Shopping

![BODEGA](media/bodega.jpg)

An app I built with my brother, [Nico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-marquez-6825681ba/). We wanted to build the most fun, addicting, and delightful shopping experience.

## PROBLEM
Mobile vs. Desktop Apparel Shopping
- Spending was significantly higher (37%) when customers shop on desktop versus mobile.
- 84% of consumers used their mobile devices to browse for fashion

A Need for an Aggregated App
- 60% of consumers do prefer mobile shopping apps over sites
- But choose not to download due to not wanting more apps on their phone (43%) and lack of phone storage (31%)

The mobile shopping experience can be optimized

## WHY HAS NO ONE SOLVED IT?
Poor Product Quality
- Although aggregated, many products come from unknown brands that look “fake”

Poor Curation
- Data collection is challenging
- Keeping up with trends
- Availability + affordability

Poor User Experiences
- Integrated experiences on existing platforms like TikTok and Amazon confuse users and feel “cluttered”

## OUR SOLUTION: BODEGA
**An app to optimize the mobile shopping experience**

AI Curation
- Single scroll feed = better data = better recommendations 
User Experience
- Addictive scrolling: Shopping as entertainment
- Gamified: Reward users for shopping

“Everything on Sale”
- Sustainability: efficiently moves on-sale stock
Scalable
- Scales to not just items on sale, and not just clothes - any shopping experience with the need for curation to become a form of entertainment
