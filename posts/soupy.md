# Soupy - A new kind of AI interface that visualizes thoughts

![Soupy Demo](media/soupy/soupy_demo.mp4)

This video is not sped up! I wanted to push the limits of what 
AI interfaces have to offer. Soupy visualizes it's thoughts with instantaneous low-poly 3D animations, transcending the chat-heavy interfaces that dominates LLM product experience landscape.

## Evaluating 3js generation capabilities
Here's a tool I built to help evaluate my prompts and model selections. I found this to be super useful as I could spin up different "cells", or configurations, of a model + prompt + scene + hyperpameters. Then, the cells would get generated in batches, allowing me to efficiently evaluate the 3D animations generated across the different configurations.
