# FITTD - Solving reverse logistics for fashion retail

![Fittd](media/fittd.jpg)

FITTD was an extremely fun startup that I started my Junior year of college with my friends [Tejas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejas-venkatesh23/), [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-i-ackermann/), and [Martina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martina-gai/). We were trying to solve **bracketing**: the practice of buying multiple sizes or colors of an item with the intent to keep only some of them. We proccessed several thousands of dollars in GMV within the first couple of weeks, and I applied to YC for the first time.
