# hellafast.dev - Build full stack apps hella fast

![Hellafast Demo](media/hellafast_demo.mp4)

I've been loving coding AI agents, especially Cursor and Bolt.new. At the time of writing this, these tools do an incredible job of frontend engineering, but still lack in capabilities for robust backends.

I wanted to build a platform that complements vibe-coding by giving an opinionated template for common backend functionalities. 

With Hellafast, you can configure a database with Prisma, Aith with NextAuth, and payments with stripe in one simple form. You can then pass this repo to Cursor or Lovable, and agents can immediately start working on the repo with clear AGENT.md guidelines.
